My name is Andreas Karagiorgis, I’ve been a street artist in Kamari, Santorini since 40 years. I specialized in handcrafting souvenirs in the form of paintings – watercolors, acryllic on cloth, wood and stone. All my offerings are 100% hand-made and unique.

The COVID-19 situation and my age forced me to stay with my family in Poland, so I decided to use the power of internet to share my art with the world.
