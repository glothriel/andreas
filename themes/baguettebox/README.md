# hugo-baguetteBox

This is a theme component for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It provides shortcodes to include an image gallery and
lightbox powered by [baguetteBox.js](https://github.com/feimosi/baguetteBox.js) in a Hugo website.


## Installation

Clone this git repository into your `themes` folder (or add it as a submodule if you're already using git):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Schnouki/hugo-baguetteBox themes/baguettebox
```

Now add this theme component to your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = ["baguettebox", "main-theme"]
```


## Usage

In a post or page, you can add a gallery using the `{{< gallery >}}` shortcode, and images inside the gallery using the
`{{< galimg >}}` shortcode:

```markdown
{{< gallery >}}
  {{% galimg target="image01.png" title="This image has a title but no caption!" /%}}
  {{% galimg target="image02.png" %}}This image has a caption!{{% /galimg %}}
  {{% galimg target="image03.png" thumb="image03_thumb.png" %}}Don't generate the thumbnail for this one, use an existing file.{{% /galimg %}}
  {{% galimg target="image04.png" size="400x300" %}}Use a different size for the thumbnailâ€¦{{% /galimg %}}
  {{% galimg target="image05.png" size="400x300 BottomLeft q90 r90" %}}You can actually use any option supported by Hugo's image processing.{{% /galimg %}}
  {{% galimg target="image06.png" mode="resize" size="100x20" %}}You can also choose the image processing method.{{% /galimg %}}
{{< /gallery >}}
```

As can be seen, the `gallery` shortcode does not accept any parameter.

The `galimg` shortcode, however, accepts several parameters:
- `target` (**required**): name for the full-size image
- `thumb` (optional): name of the thumbnail. If missing, the thumbnail will be generated by Hugo using its [image
  processing](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing).
- `size` (optional): size for the generated thumbnail. This can actually be any valid [image processing
  option](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/#image-processing-options). Defaults to `200x150 smart`.
- `mode` (optional): method used to generate the thumbnail. Can be `fill`, `fit` or `resize`. Defaults to `fill`.


## Gallery appearance

This component does *not* include a stylesheet for the gallery, you will need to add this to your site by yourself.

The generated HTML is very simple:

```html
<div class="gallery">
  <a href="/path/to/fullsize-image.jpg" data-caption="Image caption" title="Image title">
    <img src="/path/to/thumbnail.jpg alt="Image title" />
  </a>
</div>
```

Here is a sample CSS that works well with the [Minimo](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo) theme:

```css
.gallery {
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: row wrap;
    justify-content: space-around;
}
.gallery a {
    border: 0;
    margin-bottom: .5em;
}
.gallery img {
    border: .125em solid #bdbdbd;
}
```


## Dependencies

This components includes [*baguetteBox.js*](https://github.com/feimosi/baguetteBox.js), which is *very* small (less that
10 kB of JavaScript and 4 kB of CSS). It is only included on pages that need it, and has no external dependency at all.

To customize how it is loaded, you can overload the `gallery/resources.html` partial template. This way you can for instance load it from a CDN (instead of using the bundled version), or disable [fingerprintint](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/fingerprint/), or use Hugo Pipes to enable PostCSS or whatever you want.
